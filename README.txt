This uses a local llm to make suggestions that you can insert whenever you type anywhere on your computer

use the type_friend canda to use this

TODO:

get rid of new lines

make it show the text and the suggestions and the turkish translation
    multiple suggestions in separate colors



IDEAS:

make it be a box that i can gesture over to make it sticky to the mouse or i can just place it places

make gestures hook up to that state.txt file, so that i can use gestures to change the state of the program, between turkish or whatever language

i can have toggles that show in turkish or whatever language as well, even if it is just a translation of what i have already written.

would be cool if it goes fact checking and finding sources, either from my library or from the web
